        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><em>Last updated: May 15, 2024</em></p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p>Your privacy matters to us. This Privacy Policy outlines how the Amazon Review Analyzer Pro extension collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our Chrome extension.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Amazon Review Analyzer Pro is a Chrome extension that helps users analyze and summarize Amazon product reviews using artificial intelligence through services like Perplexity API and OpenAI API.</p>

        <h2>2. Information Collection</h2>
        <p><strong>We do not collect, store, or transmit your personal information</strong> to our servers. All data processing occurs locally within your browser:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>API keys that you provide for AI services (Perplexity, OpenAI, or custom endpoints)</li>
            <li>Extension settings and user preferences</li>
            <li>Cached review summaries (stored locally to prevent redundant API calls)</li>
            <li>Amazon product information and publicly available review content that you choose to analyze</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Data Usage</h2>
        <p>The extension uses information solely to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Analyze and summarize Amazon product reviews by sending review text to the AI service you've configured</li>
            <li>Store generated summaries locally for faster access when revisiting products</li>
            <li>Customize your experience based on your saved preferences</li>
            <li>Enable basic extension functionality</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Required Permissions</h2>
        <p>To provide its functionality, the extension requires these Chrome permissions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>activeTab/tabs:</strong> To identify the current Amazon product page and gather review content</li>
            <li><strong>storage:</strong> To store your settings, API keys, and cached summaries locally</li>
            <li><strong>host permissions (amazon.com and related domains):</strong> To access and analyze product reviews</li>
            <li><strong>host permissions (AI service endpoints):</strong> To communicate with Perplexity/OpenAI APIs for review analysis</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We request only the minimum permissions necessary for the extension to function properly.</p>

        <h2>5. API Key Security</h2>
        <p>Your API keys are:</p>

            <li>Never transmitted to our servers</li>
            <li>Only sent directly to the respective AI service when you request review analysis</li>
            <li>Fully under your control - you can remove them at any time</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Review Data Processing</h2>
        <p>When you analyze a product:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Publicly available Amazon review content is sent to the AI service you've configured</li>
            <li>This data is processed according to the respective AI service's terms and policies</li>
            <li>Review content is only sent when you explicitly request analysis</li>
            <li>Results are cached locally in your browser to improve performance</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The extension integrates with these third-party services:</p>
